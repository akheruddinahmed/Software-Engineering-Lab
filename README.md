# Software Engineering Lab - Practical Programs

This repository contains a collection of Python programs for various fundamental operations, typically covered in a Software Engineering Lab. Below is a brief description of each program included:

## List of Python Programs

1. **add_two_matrices.py** - Adds two matrices element-wise.
2. **average_percentage.py** - Calculates average and percentage of marks.
3. **diagonal_elements.py** - Prints the diagonal elements of a matrix.
4. **maximum.py / maxnum.py** - Finds the maximum number from a list or matrix.
5. **multiply_two_matrices.py** - Multiplies two matrices.
6. **row_wise_sum.py** - Calculates row-wise sum of a matrix.
7. **smallest_num.py / smallest.py** - Finds the smallest number in a list or matrix.
8. **structure_program.py** - Demonstrates the structure of a basic Python program.
9. **sum_matrix_using_numpy.py** - Sums matrices using NumPy for efficiency.

## Usage

Each file is a standalone script. Run any file using:

```bash
python filename.py
```

Ensure you have Python installed. For NumPy-based files, install NumPy using:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
